1. Fork the Assessment Repository

    Go to the GitHub repository link provided in your assessment.
    Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository

    Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/assessment-repo.git
cd assessment-repo
3. Set Up the Notification Service (Node.js)

    If the project isn't already initialized with Node.js, set it up:
npm init -y

Install necessary dependencies:
npm install express nodemailer dotenv

Create the basic structure for the notification service:
mkdir src
touch src/index.js .env

Implement the basic service in `src/index.js`:
const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/notify', async (req, res) => {
  const { to, subject, text } = req.body;

  try {
    let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
      service: 'Gmail',
      auth: {
        user: process.env.EMAIL,
        pass: process.env.PASSWORD,
      },
    });

    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: process.env.EMAIL,
      to,
      subject,
      text,
    });

    res.status(200).send('Notification sent successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error sending notification');
  }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

Add your email credentials in the `.env` file:
EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
PASSWORD=your-email-password
PORT=3000

4. Set Up the Cloud Infrastructure (AWS or GCP)

    AWS Option:
        EC2:
            Launch an EC2 instance with Ubuntu.
            SSH into the instance, install Node.js, and clone your GitHub repository.
            Run your service using pm2 or nohup to keep it alive.
        Elastic Beanstalk:
            Package your application.
            Deploy it using Elastic Beanstalk for easy scalability.
        RDS (Optional for DB): If the service requires a database, set up an RDS instance.
    GCP Option:
        Compute Engine:
            Launch a VM instance, SSH into it, and deploy the Node.js service.
        App Engine:
            Deploy your Node.js application on GCP's App Engine for auto-scaling.
        Cloud SQL (Optional for DB): Set up a Cloud SQL instance if a database is required.
5. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline

    GitHub Actions:
        Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file for CI/CD:
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to EC2/GCP
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}@${{ secrets.EC2_IP }} << 'EOF'
        cd /path/to/your/app
        git pull origin main
        npm install
        pm2 restart all
        EOF
        Set the necessary secrets in the GitHub repository for SSH access to your EC2 instance or GCP VM.

6. Test the CI/CD Pipeline

    Push code changes to your repository and observe the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it builds, tests, and deploys your application successfully.

7. Prepare the Screencast

    Use screen recording software like OBS Studio, Camtasia, or any tool of your choice.
    Record the following:
        Forking the repository.
        Setting up the project locally.
        Deploying the project to the cloud.
        Demonstrating the CI/CD pipeline by pushing a code change and showing the automatic deployment.
        Testing the notification service by sending a request to your deployed service.
    Save the screencast and upload it to a video-sharing platform like YouTube or Vimeo.

8. Raise a Pull Request

    Push your final changes to your forked repository.
    Go to the original repository and create a pull request from your forked branch to the main branch of the original repo.
    Provide a detailed description of your implementation, including the CI/CD pipeline and deployment steps.

9. Share the Pull Request and Screencast Links

    Once the pull request is raised, copy the link.
    Copy the link to your screencast as well.
    Share both links as the final step.

Example of the final response:

    Pull Request Link: [Your PR Link Here]
    Screencast Link: [Your Screencast Link Here]

This should comprehensively guide you through building the cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js-based Notification Service.
